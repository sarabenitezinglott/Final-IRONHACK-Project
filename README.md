## State of the Art

An ischemic stroke occurs when a blood clot, known as a thrombus, plugs or blocks an artery which supplies the brain. As a result, the blood flow is restricted, not allowing the gas exchange and nutrition of the organs and tissues [[1](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/17060-how-does-the-blood-flow-through-your-heart)]. This happens in critical and risky situations, when the blood blockage reaches the brain. At first, when the tissue is deprived of supply, cells begin to die; however, as time goes on, the likelihood of experiencing a stroke increases, which can lead to permanent brain damages or even death [[2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10112237/#:~:text=Mortality%20in%20the%20first%2030,on%20early%20treatment(11).)]

In conclus  ion: it is a **medical emergency** that needs immediate care. 

It is usually age-related, althought two-thirds of all strokes happen in people over the age of 65. However, there are also certain medical conditions that an either cause these kinds of strokes or make them more likely to happen. 


## Clot formation - Molecular Biology Backgroud

A blood clot, also known as a thrombus, is a gel-like or semisolid mass formed by the coagulation of blood. It is primarily composed of platelets and fibrin, which are key components of the blood clotting process.

Here's a brief overview of the components involved in the formation of a blood clot:

Platelets: These are small cell fragments in the blood that play a crucial role in clotting. When a blood vessel is injured, platelets adhere to the site and release chemical signals to attract more platelets. They then stick together to form a temporary "platelet plug."

Fibrin: Fibrin is a protein that forms a mesh-like structure, reinforcing the platelet plug and creating a stable blood clot. It is produced through a series of enzymatic reactions involving clotting factors.

Clotting Factors: These are proteins present in the blood that play a role in the coagulation cascade, a complex series of events leading to the formation of a blood clot. Clotting factors work in a cascade, with each step activating the next, ultimately leading to the conversion of fibrinogen into fibrin.

### CE vs LAA

The main differences between both of them:

- At a cellular level: 

    - Amount of red and white blood cells

## Aim 
The goal of this project is to classify the blood clot etilogy in ischemic stroke by generating a Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
