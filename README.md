## State of the Art

An ischemic stroke occurs when a blood clot, known as a thrombus, plugs or blocks an artery which supplies the brain. Therefore, if the bloodflow stops, these not-supplied tissue will start dying, and if it does not return quickly enough, an ischemic stroke will cause permanent brain damages or even death. 

Is a **medical emergency** that needs immediate care. 



It is usually age-related, althought two-thirds of all strokes happen in people over the age of 65. However, there are also certain medical conditions that an either cause these kinds of strokes or make them more likely to happen. 



## Aim 
The goal of this project is to classify the blood clot etilogy in ischemic stroke by generating a Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
